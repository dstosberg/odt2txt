odt2txt is known to compile on Linux, Windows (Cygwin and native),
Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD.

To build odt2txt you need GNU make on all platforms.  On platforms
other than Linux and Cygwin, it is usually called "gmake".

Linux:
	A modern Linux system has everything you need in the
	libc. Just run "make" in the source directory.

Solaris:
	Everything you need comes with the system.
	I have test-compiled odt2txt on Solaris 9 (sparc) and
	Solaris 10 (x86), both with gcc and the Sun C Compiler.

FreeBSD/OpenBSD:
	You need to install libiconv from the ports.

	The regex library that comes with FreeBSD is extremely slow
	on my FreeBSD system (5.3, i386).

Mac OS X:
	libiconv has to be installed separately. The Makefile contains
	support for a MacPorts installation:

	- install MacPorts http://www.macports.org/
	- install libiconv in MacPorts
	  $ sudo port install libiconv
	- run "make" in the source directory

NetBSD:
	NetBSD > 2.0 comes with an iconv implementation, it has everything
	you need.

HP-UX:
        If zlib is not already installed on the system, build it.  Then
        build odt2txt with "gmake ZLIB_DIR=/path/to/zlib"

Windows (Cygwin):
	You need to install libiconv.

Windows (mingw32):
	See win32/Dockerfile for a recipe build a windows package.
